Module 8 Challenge (prophet-challenge)

## Overview
With over 200 million users, Mercado Libre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. This is to analyze the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. We need to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.
